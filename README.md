This is an application that I'm developing to learn how concurrency works in elixir. 
It's mean't to be a IRC like server that allows chatting between users.

# TODO
* Implement TLS for more secure messaging [ ]
* Create a TUI front end [ ]
* Refine the protocol [ ]
* Create database storage [ ]
* Create an administration system so servers belong to users. [ ]
* Allow for the creation of channels inside the servers. [ ]
** Each channel should be in it's own thread. [ ]
** Channel layouts should persist. [ ]
* Try to add VoIP (This may be a bit of a stretch). [ ]
